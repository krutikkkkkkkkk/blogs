# What is TypeScript and Why you should Learn it

# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

We should plunge further into what TypeScript is and how it can help JavaScript clients.

## Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a specific, object-situated, ordered programming language that expands on JavaScript. It is a superset of the JavaScript language, intended to give you better tooling at any scale.

The lead modeller behind TypeScript is Anders Hejlsberg, architect of C# at Microsoft. TypeScript is open source, upheld by Microsoft, and thought about a language and a bunch of instruments.

TypeScript refers to itself as "JavaScript with language structure for types." to put it plainly, it is JavaScript for certain extra elements.

## Components of TypeScript

TypeScript includes three primary parts: Language, the TypeScript Compiler, and the TypeScript Language Administration.

**1. Language:** the syntax, keywords, and type annotations.

**2. The TypeScript Compiler (TSC): **changes over the guidelines in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent.

**3. The TypeScript Language Service: ** an additional layer of editor-like applications, such as statement completion, signature help, code formatting, and colourization, among other things.


## What TypeScript Does

TypeScript is often considered “JavaScript and more.” More precisely, there are four main goals of TypeScript:

 
 1. Make JavaScript improvement more productive
 2. Acquaint discretionary sorts with JavaScript
 3. Assist with getting botches prior
 4. Carry out arranged highlights of future JavaScript


### Static Typing and Type Inference


JavaScript is dynamically typed. In other words, until a variable is instantiated at runtime, JavaScript cannot know what type it is.

But in some scenarios, this may be too late. And if a variable is falsely assumed to be a certain type, this can cause significant bugs.

This is another area where TypeScript adds support for loosely typed JavaScript.

With TLS (the TypeScript Language Service mentioned above), TypeScript has an optional static typing and type inference system that can infer undeclared variables. Thus, by adding type support to JavaScript, TypeScript can effectively mitigate type errors during compilation to JavaScript.


### Compilation

Once more, one of the greatest downsides of JavaScript is that it is hard to track down and correct mistakes.

This is mostly because of the way that JavaScript is a deciphered language and, accordingly, should be rushed to test that it's substantial. What's more, in the situation that there is a mistake, clients are in many cases left on a pointless pursuit to track down the bugs in the code.

TypeScript helps make blunder-checking simpler.

As TypeScript accumulates the code, it will recognize punctuation blunders and advise clients by creating aggregation mistakes. Consequently, TypeScript assists clients with getting bugs at the incorporate time as opposed to holding on until runtime.


# Why Use TypeScript?

TypeScript expands on JavaScript to successfully fill in the holes and give designers better tooling at any scale. Gauged against its rivals, TypeScript is both simpler and more proficient.

**Convenience**
One of the central benefits of TypeScript is its convenience. If you are somewhat acquainted with JavaScript, it will require almost no work to get everything rolling with TypeScript. This is because everything TypeScript code is changed over into its JavaScript code identical for execution.

On the other hand, any JavaScript (.js) record can be renamed to a TypeScript (.ts) document for gathering with other TypeScript records.

**Portability**
In numerous ways, TypeScript is JavaScript, i.e., TypeScript code converts to JavaScript to run any place JavaScript runs. Thusly, clients can have certainty that TypeScript can run on any climate that JavaScript runs on — programs, gadgets, and working frameworks.

This stands out from numerous TypeScript contenders that require a committed VM or explicit runtime conditions for execution.

**Robust Developer Tooling Support**
Generally, TypeScript means to work on engineers' proficiency and efficiency by moderating blunders, helping critical thinking, and conveying better tooling at scale.

TSC is likewise favourable for engineers since it can run as a foundation interaction to help gather and IDE integration.

# How to Get Started with TypeScript

To get started using TypeScript, the best approach is gradual adoption.

This means incrementally applying types to your JavaScript to improve your codebase and editor support, step by step.

The most common way to use TypeScript is to use TSC:

Write the TypeScript code.
Then, use TSC to compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code.
Finally, deploy the JavaScript code to any environment that runs JavaScript.
